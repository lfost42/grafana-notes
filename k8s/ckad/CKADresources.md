# CKAD Resources

[KodeKloud](https://kodekloud.com) - This is a great place to start, but I don't know how people pass with just KodeKloud and otherwise little or no background. There is info that is missing and a lot of extra info you don't need. I felt this way about both the course the mock exams. I would end up finding a handful of questions I wanted to practice in the mock exams, but navigating to them was a chore since you have to scroll and load each question before skipping to another question.

It bothered me that there were so many Helm and CRD questions in the mock exams (which none of us get) yet only very basic questions on resources and ingress. There were no LimitRange or Docker/Podman questions in the mock exams and none of the ingress questions used traefik as an ingress class or required hosts.

I expected this to be my main resource but the scenarios are too limited in scope.

[killer.sh](https://github.com/sailor-sh/CK-X) - This is more challenging than the exam in that each question has many parts but the questions don't reach the complexity you'll see on the exam. It's free so I do recommend using it as well as going through the guidance solutions since it might cover something you haven't seen before, but I don't consider it a good gauge for readiness.

[omar-shelke25](https://killercoda.com/omkar-shelke25) - This set of killercoda questions isn't mentioned very frequently but I thought it did a good job in filling in the holes I ran into in KodeKloud and kill-sh, particularly with resources, ingress, and rbac. I definitely appreciated being able to practice podman and docker!

[sailor](https://sailor.sh) - I'm surprised I don't see this mentioned more often, but I found these mock exams more useful than both KodeKloud and killer.sh (there are 2). Some of the questions were more complicated than what you would get on the exam but this would have set more realistic expectations than KodeKloud or killer.sh. I also liked that I could keep working on the exam after time was up (unlike KodeKloud) and recalculate my score to see if my edits worked (similar to killer but you aren't limited to 36 hours!).

The main downside to this one is, there is no solution guide or answer key, just a check on whether your solution meets the requirements or not. There were a few items I couldn't turn green but it didn't keep me from learning what I needed. At some point I'll circle back and figure those out but I suspect at least a few are a unit test quirk on the answer check that needs to be updated to be more flexible. This is fully open source so I'd love to contribute to this once I complete my cert goals!

[mattburman](https://mattburman.com/how-i-passed-the-ckad-exam) - This had some good tips on setting up your terminal panels. It wasn't not useful for me on the exam because I'm on a laptop with limited screen space but it's great for studying and working with k8s in general.

[codebob75](https://medium.com/@codebob75/passing-ckad-cheatsheet-notes-and-tips-1aa285e6a473) - This is a classic resource but I wanted to include it anyway. Some of it is deprecated by now (like the docker question). I'm also not sure about what he means when he says notepad and being able to copy/paste into it, I couldn't find one on the test so I just used a second terminal with vim.

[dumbitguy](https://youtube.com/watch?v=ZqGDdETii8c) - I ran into this when starting CKA and think the info here might have helped me figure out one of the resource questions I had on CKAD.

[miroberes](https://miroberes.github.io) - A handful of VIM tips that I didn't already know by the time I found it.
