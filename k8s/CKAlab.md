# CKA Lab

I created this lab using [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fr9GqFwl6NM)

Since I have a Macbook Air, I went with [UTM](https://mac.getutm.app) with an [Ubuntu 25.10](https://cdimage.ubuntu.com/releases/25.10/release/ubuntu-25.10-desktop-arm64.iso?_gl=1*1y1yumr*_gcl_au*MTg1OTAzMDk2Ny4xNzYzMDE3MjA0) (ARM 64-bit architecture) iso to create 2 operating systems, default settings.
