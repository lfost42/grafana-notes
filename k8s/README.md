# Kubernetes

While I intended to pick up Grafana, I learned quickly that I really needed to get my Kubernetes fundamentals first. Especially after having finished CKAD, it alone was not enough so I'm following the path to Kubstronaut before I circle back. 

My favorite Kubernetes resource so far is [Cloud With VarJosh](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLmPit9IIdzwRjqD-l_sZBDdPlcSfKqpAt). In addition to lectures, he also includes hands-on work for better retention. He does not begin with the assumption that you already know certain things and will even point you to a previous lecture if the new material builds on another concept. 

Right now, I'm working on [CKA](../cka/README.md)
