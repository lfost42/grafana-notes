# CKA Resources

Since I needed to understand k8s architecture for this one, it was time to set up a cluster from scratch using [Linux VMs](k8s/CKAlab.md).

For mine, I followed [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fr9GqFwl6NM). This series is deprecated so I had to update some things to make it work. 

### [Cloud With VarJosh](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLmPit9IIdzwRjqD-l_sZBDdPlcSfKqpAt)

Wow, if you're not sure where your k8s gaps are, this is the series you want to eatch! He does an excellent job at tying all the relevant concepts together instead of just throwing them at you like your typical Stack Overflow answer section. 

He is engaging and also gets excited about showing off something he thinks his audience would enjoy. I highly recommend this one!

### Lab Practice

For lab practice, I spun up a local version of [sailor-sh](k8s/CKAplab.md) which is an exam simulator comparable to killer.sh. There were some things that wouldn't work and required a detour to a [Killercoda Playground](https://killercoda.com/playgrounds/scenario/cka). However, I like to work with CK-X whenever possible to get used to the interface. 

I am toying with the idea of creating a CKA set for sailor-sh but that will need to wait until my to-do list dwindles down a bit and I'm less constrained for time. 

#### Labs
- [IT Kiddie](itkiddie.md)
- [DumbItGuy](dumbitguy.md) -- in progress

Planned:
- [simonbbb](https://github.com/simonbbbb/CKA-Hand-on-lab) - This one creates the cluster so you'll be running this on your local terminal which is why I'm saving it for last. 

Youtube:
- [JayDemy](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLSsEvm2nF_8nGkhMyD1sq-DqjwQq8fAii) - This is usually mentioned a long with IT Kiddie and DumbItGuy but I couldn't find any accompanying labs to go with it so I'll watch it once I'm done with labs. 
- [Atla3](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eGv6iPWQKyo) - This covers some gotchas that were added to CKA recently. I'll add notes when I give it a rewatch.
