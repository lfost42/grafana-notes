# CKA Resources

Since I needed to understand k8s architecture for this one, it was time to set up a cluster from scratch using [Linux VMs](k8s/CKAlab.md).

For mine, I followed [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fr9GqFwl6NM). This series is deprecated so I had to update some things to make it work. 

### [Cloud With VarJosh](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLmPit9IIdzwRjqD-l_sZBDdPlcSfKqpAt)

If you're not sure where your k8s gaps are, this is the series you want to watch! He does an excellent job at tying all the relevant concepts together instead of just throwing them at you like your typical Stack Overflow answer section. 

He is engaging and also gets excited about showing off something he thinks his audience would enjoy. I highly recommend this one!

### Lab Practice

- [IT Kiddie](itkiddie.md) - Clone into [killercoda playground](https://killercoda.com/playgrounds/scenario/cka) or other local lab. I don't think these were made by IT Kiddie, but by someone else who wanted to practice those labs.  
- [simonbbb](https://github.com/simonbbbb/CKA-Hand-on-lab) - This one creates the cluster so killercoda would not be necessary to complete it.  

### Youtube Playlists

For Learning Concepts and general practice:  
- [Cloud With VarJosh](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLmPit9IIdzwRjqD-l_sZBDdPlcSfKqpAt) - I sung his praises earlier.  

Exam-specific advice and guides (the trio for the big 17):  
- [IT Kiddie](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLkDZsCgo3Isr4NB5cmyqG7OZwYEx5XOjM)  
- [JayDemy](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLSsEvm2nF_8nGkhMyD1sq-DqjwQq8fAii)  
- [DumbItGuy](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLvZb3tGyqC1TOasSaN36haM5xlCxHQBlA) - he also has a github for labs but I had issues with them.  

- [Atla3](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eGv6iPWQKyo) - This covers some gotchas that were added to CKA in 2025.  
- [DevOpsMasters](https://www.youtube.com/@DevOpsMasters) - Explanations for killer.sh questions. I did the first killer.sh just because. It's not directly helpful but it's always a good exercise the same week of the exam. Don't worry too much if you don't score well.  

### Mock Exams

- [CK-X Simulator](https://github.com/sailor-sh/CK-X/tree/master) - This creates a local lab and had a decent variety of questions. I'm not writing too much on it because a lot of it is deprecated and for novices, you'll likely find this more trouble than its worth. For example, the HPA question required version autoscaling/v1beta.  

I like the way the lab simulated the testing environment (similar to killer.sh) and I performed the github labs with it at first. But at some point, not enough worked well enough to stick with it. It was more useful for CKAD.
