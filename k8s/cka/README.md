# CKA Resources

Since I needed to understand k8s architecture for this one, it was time to set up a cluster from scratch using [Linux VMs](k8s/CKAlab.md). For mine, I followed [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fr9GqFwl6NM). This series is deprecated so I had to update some things to make it work. 

### [Cloud With VarJosh](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLmPit9IIdzwRjqD-l_sZBDdPlcSfKqpAt)

If you're not sure where your k8s gaps are, this is the series you want to watch. He does an excellent job at tying all the relevant concepts together instead of just throwing them at you like your typical Stack Overflow answer section. 

He is engaging and also gets excited about showing off something he thinks his audience would enjoy. I highly recommend this one!

### Lab Practice

- [CameronMetcalfe22 Notes](CameronMetcalfe22.md) - Clone the [repo](https://github.com/CameronMetcalfe22/CKA-PREP) into [killercoda playground](https://killercoda.com/playgrounds/scenario/cka) or other local lab. These were based on the IT Kiddie series but they're all the same questions as JayDemy and DumbItGuy. 

### Exam-Specific Series

This trio covers the big 17. I don't really have a preference, I spent more timee on the GitHub labs than watching these:  
- [IT Kiddie](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLkDZsCgo3Isr4NB5cmyqG7OZwYEx5XOjM)  
- [JayDemy](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLSsEvm2nF_8nGkhMyD1sq-DqjwQq8fAii)  
- [DumbItGuy](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLvZb3tGyqC1TOasSaN36haM5xlCxHQBlA) - he also has a github for labs but I had issues with them.  

- [Atla3](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eGv6iPWQKyo) - This covers some gotchas that were added to CKA in 2025.  
- [DevOpsMasters](https://www.youtube.com/@DevOpsMasters) - Explanations for killer.sh questions. I did the first killer.sh just because. It's not directly helpful but it's always a good exercise the same week of the exam. Don't worry too much if you don't score well.  

- [CK-X Simulator](https://github.com/sailor-sh/CK-X/tree/master) - This creates a local lab with a good variety of questions. I like the remote desktop, similar to killer.sh. I originally tried the github labs with it but it wouldn't curl for network questions and the environment itself is too deprecated to work with too much. It was more helpful for CKAD.
