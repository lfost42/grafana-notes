# My Grafana Learning Notes

![logo](./logo.png)

1. [Grafana Fundamentals](https://learn.grafana.com/path/grafana-fundamentals) - GROT Academy is a newer enablement resource aimed at de-mystifying Observability. The course is geared toward both technical and non-technical folks, but my takeaway so far is, in order to get actionable value from Grafana, I first need to level up on Kubernetes.

Kubernetes defines the metrics, labels, and lifecycles we’re trying to visualize. With that context in hand, dashboards can become actionable insights. Luckily, there was a sale on [Thrive Annual](https://training.linuxfoundation.org/subscriptions/) so I picked up a subscription to help me get there!

11/11/2025 Update: There's nothing like completing a full course in Kubernetes to learn how much I still needed to learn! I just completed CKAD, the first cert in my goal to Kubstronaut. While I'm sure I can get what I need without KCNA and KCSA, my work will pay for it and I want that jacket! I know it won't put me on the same level as an enterprise SRE but I work with those pretty often and I'd like to be able to contribute more when I'm sitting at the table.
