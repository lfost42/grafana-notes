# My Grafana Learning Notes

![logo](./logo.png)

[Grafana Fundamentals](https://learn.grafana.com/path/grafana-fundamentals) was my first stop. GROT Academy is a newer enablement resource aimed at de-mystifying Observability. The course is geared toward both technical and non-technical folks, but my takeaway so far has been clear: to really get value from Grafana, I first need to level up on Kubernetes.

Kubernetes defines the metrics, labels, and lifecycles weâ€™re trying to visualize. And with that context in hand, dashboards become real, actionable insights. Luckily, there was a sale on [Thrive Annual](https://training.linuxfoundation.org/subscriptions/) so I picked up a subscription to help me get there!
