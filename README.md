# My Grafana Learning Notes

![logo](./logo.png)

### [Grafana Fundamentals](https://learn.grafana.com/path/grafana-fundamentals)

GROT Academy is a newer enablement resource aimed at de-mystifying Observability. The course is geared toward both technical and non-technical folks, but my takeaway so far is, in order to get actionable value from Grafana, I first need to level up on Kubernetes. 

Kubernetes defines the metrics, labels, and lifecycles we’re trying to visualize. With that context in hand, dashboards can become actionable insights. Luckily, there was a sale on [Thrive Annual](https://training.linuxfoundation.org/subscriptions/) so I picked up a subscription to help me get there! I'll circle back to Grafana once I am more solid in my k8s skills and hopefully by then GROT will have more content by then!

### [Kubstronaut Adventures](/k8s/README.md)

There's nothing like completing a course in Kubernetes to learn how much I still needed to learn! Upon completing CKAD, I decided that I also needed CKA and CKS. Then I thought, work will pay for KCNA and KCSA and Kubstronaut does come with a really nice jacket! 

All joking aside, I work with Site Reliability Engineers pretty often during sev1s and I'd like to be able to contribute more when I'm sitting at the table. Work also has me moving into supporting MuleSoft so this is a good way to understand the Runtime Fabric and what actually goes on under all that abstraction. 

#### [CKAD Resources](k8s/ckad/CKADresources.md) 

I was able to leverage my previous experience as a DevOps Associate to complete this one. 

#### [CKA Resources](k8s/cka/README.md)

I'm currently working towards completing CKA. But these are the resources I'm using so far!

### Grafana Technical Practitioner

My reward for finishing Kubstronaut will be taking GROT's new [Technical Practitioner Path 101](https://learn.grafana.com/path/technical-practitioner-path). I'll be using this to start adding more detailed notes about Grafana and demystifying that learning process.
